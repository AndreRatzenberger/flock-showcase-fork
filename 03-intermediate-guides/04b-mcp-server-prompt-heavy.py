"""
Purpose: Demonstrating how to use Flock's MCP integration

Use Case: GitHub Repository Creator üêô - Create GitHub repositories from Flock.

Also highlights two different "philosophies" of how to build agents

Pure declarative agent (04a-mcp-server.py)
vs.
Prompt-heavy agent (04b-mcp-server.py)

# Have Docker installed in its latest version

# Have a GitHub personal access token with repo permissions (https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
# Add the personal access token to the environment variable GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN

# --- YOUR TURN! ---
# 1. Try to use the 04a-mcp-server.py to create a repository.
# 2. Try to use the 04b-mcp-server.py to create a repository.
#
# Which agent does produce the better results?
# How can you improve both agents while keeping their 'philosophy' (prompt-heavy vs pure declarative)?
